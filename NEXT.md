## In Progress

- In Journal Log, after a log is done, attach a little comment by the llm, who have all the logs and the contract in context -> So for example, I might say: my first run, I'm so proud! and the llm will post a comment to congratulate me on that. The comment can be displayed below the Log, similar to a whatsapp discussion.


## Next Steps
- Build an AI App to help you execute on Sami Board meeting
- Allow archiving the daily brief once I read it.
- Ensure the Dialy Brief showing in the homepage has the logs of yesteday as part of the context.

## Done
- Continue Auto Keep Design Deployments and thinking

- When the user claim victory of a contract, create a much more delightful experience, it should not just hide and that's it, acknowledge their victory and make them feel proud and happy!
- add daily push notifications via PWA with a review of current protocols
- Add a daily LLM feedback based on logs, current contract, user goals (README.MD of the User, based on the 3 pillars, Sami Board Meetings etc)
- Add the Recyle Bin into 2 dots option.
- Allow text logs in each entry
- Add Penality showing in the homepage
- Increase the limits of Exclusions to 5

## Backlog
- Build the Witness Feature - so there is a sharable link to someone and they can see if you break or violate
- add the Judge LLM Feature when skipping
