## Next Steps
- Add a daily LLM feedback based on logs, current contract, user goals (README.MD of the User, based on the 3 pillars, Sami Board Meetings etc)
- Allow text logs in each entry
- Add Penality showing in the homepage
- Build the Witness Feature - so there is a sharable link to someone and they can see if you break or violate
- Add the Recyle Bin into 2 dots option.
- Increase the limits of Exclusions to 5
- add daily push notifications via PWA with a review of current protocols
- add the Judge LLM Feature when skipping
- Build an AI App to help you execute on Sami Board meeting
- When a contract is completed (if for example it's only for 1D, detect that as well) -> Show a happiness thingy!
